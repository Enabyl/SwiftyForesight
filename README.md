# SwiftyForesight (beta)
Swift API for integrating mobile applications with Foresight cloud framework.

## Installation
`SwiftyForesight` is available for installation via CocoaPods. In your Podfile, enter `pod 'SwiftyForesight'`, then from the terminal enter `pod install`.

## User Guide
This library provides an easy interface between iOS devices and the Foresight cloud platform. iOS devices built on the Foresight framework must (1) connect to AWS cloud services, (2) transmit data in the proper format, and (3) download and run custom computational models as they are remotely generated. For these three tasks, this library provides three important classes: `CloudManager`, `LibraData`, and `LibraModel`.

**Important Note**: All asynchronous functions in `SwiftyForesight` include completion handlers. Please use these handlers in cases where data transfer should be synchronized with other processes by using `DispatchGroup`. 

### AWS Dependencies
As the Foresight framework utilizes Amazon Web Services, important AWS dependencies are installed with the `SwiftyForesight` CocoaPod, if they aren't installed already. To use this library, ensure that you have obtained information about your AWS resources from an Enabyl representative. Also ensure that you have received your `awsconfiguration.json` file and have included it in your main project directory.

### Importing SwiftyForesight
In any file in which `SwiftyForesight` classes are used, include `import SwiftyForesight` in the file header.

### CloudManager
The `CloudManager` class manages the data connection between the iOS application and various AWS resources. It defines a variety of functions used by the `LibraData` and `LibraModels` classes to communicate with their respective AWS resources. Instantiate your application's `CloudManager` object by calling the initializer.

```swift
// Instantiate CloudManager object
let cloudManager = CloudManager(identityID: "<name>", userID: "<name>", writeBucket: "<name>", readBucket: "<name>")
```
An **important note** is that each user on a device using the Foresight framework should have a unique alphanumeric user ID assigned to them. An easy way to generate this ID is to use `UUID.uuidstring()` and storing this ID in the Keychain or User Defaults. This ID is used by the Foresight framework to identify user-specific models, generate performance reports, and more, so it is in the developer's best interest to ensure this ID is kept consistent.

This class requires the user to specify their identity ID (found in their `awsconfiguration.json` file), the S3 bucket name to which they are transmitting data, and the S3 bucket name from which computational models are downloaded. There is only one use case in which you may wish to directly call a `CloudManager` method, as detailed [below](#datamanagement).

### LibraModel
#### Initializing
`LibraModel` is a superclass for all computational models generated by the Foresight framework. Depending on your appilcation, you may have one or more subclass of `LibraModel` running on your device. The two model subtypes currently supported are `SequentialModel` (e.g. LSTM) and `FeedforwardModel` (e.g. Softmax). The below example shows how to instantiate a `SequentialModel` object, however the same process could be performed for a `FeedforwardModel`.

```swift 
// Instantiate SequentialModel object
let myModel = SequentialModel(modelClass: MLModel(), numInputFeatures: 10, localFilepath: <path>, withManager: cloudManager)
```

The argument `modelClass` may be used to input a `MLModel` object if one is already installed in the main application bundle as a placeholder until remote models are downloaded and compiled -- in most cases, this will be left with a placeholder as shown above. The user must specify the number of input features in their model, as well as the local filepath (including .mlmodel filename) where remotely-compiled models will be temporarily stored. Finally, the user should include the `CloudManager` object defined earlier so that the model can manage its AWS connection. Perform this process for each computational model that will run on your device.

#### Model Configuration
In order to generate predictions with a `LibraModel`, the names assigned to the input and output nodes of the model at the time of training/saving must be specified. The default values for input and output nodes are automatically handled by the `SwiftyForesight` API, however if you set custom names for the input and output nodes of your model you must specify them with the function `seFeatures()`.

#### Fetching and Using Models
The `LibraModel` superclass includes two useful methods for performing tasks with these models. These include: 
- `fetch()`: Fetches and downloads the most recent model from the Foresight server platform.
- `predict()`: Generates predictions based on provided input vectors.

Formatting data for prediction is a simple task. For squential models, feature vectors should be provided in list format (i.e. `[[Double]]`), with each entry being a single feature vector. The total number of feature vectors should correspond with `numInputFeatures` specified above. For feedforward models, feature vectors should be provided in `[Double]` format, with the number of elements also corresponding to `numInputFeatures`. The `predict()` function will return results in `MLMultiArray` objects, from which the elements can be extracted to obtain model predictions.

### LibraData
#### Initializing
`LibraData` objects perform the role of formatting data to be sent to remote server resources for training. For each model that is being remotely trained, a `LibraData` object should be instantiated and used to format and upload training data. The first step is to instantiate the object as follows.

```swift
let myData = LibraData(hasTimestamp: true, featureVectors: 10, labelVectorLength: 3, withManager: cloudManager)
```
The argument `hasTimestamp` is used during model training to inform how the first feature vector is treated. The `featureVectors` argument should specify how many feature vectors the data has NOT including the timestamp column. `labelVectorLength` specifies the length of the label vector (e.g. for a softmax classifier with three classes, `labelVectorLength` = 3). 

#### Formatting Data
**NOTE** that for both feedforward and sequential models, each feature vector reprents the values of a single feature over training samples, not a cross-section of all features at a single timestep. Below is a demonstrative example of how data should be formatted.

```swift
// Collect features and labels
let featureVector1 = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]  // First input feature values at t = 1, 2, 3
let featureVector2 = [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]  // Second input feature values at t = 1, 2, 3
let labelVector1 = [0.0, 1.0]         // First label vector at t = 1
let labelVector2 = [1.0, 0.0]         // Second label vector at t = 2
let labelVector3 = [1.0, 0.0]         // Third label vector at t = 3

// Format features and labels into an array for import to LibraData object
let features = [featureVector1, featureVector2]         // Feature vector
let labels = [labelVector1, labelVector2, labelVector3] // Label vector
```

#### Transmitting Data
To format the data for upload, add the feature and label vectors into the `LibraData` object and upload.

```swift
myData.addFeatures(features)  // Add features to object
myData.addLabels(labels)      // Add labels to object
myData.formatData()           // Formatting data for upload
myData.uploadDataToRemote(fromLocalFile: <path>)  // Uploading data to remote
```
The function `formatData()` formats the training data and saves it as a local .csv file. This file is automatically given the name `<userID>_<eventDate>.csv` so that it may be properly processed at a later time. This file is then uploaded to the remote AWS resource with the function `uploadDataToRemote()` with the same filename. Notice that the local file path must be specified -- this is because the function `uploadDataToRemote()` is also used by other functions in the `SwiftyForesight` framework. However, the function `formatData()` returns the filename in a completion handler, which may then be passed directly to `uploadDataToRemote()`. Note also that `LibraData` includes a safeguard to retry all failed uploads at a later time (e.g., when network connection is lost).

```swift
// Retrying all failed uploads
myData.retryFailedUploads()
```

If the user desires to delete all data files associated with failed uploads on the device, `LibraData` also includes the function `clearErrorLogs()`, which can be used to clear this data if it begins to consume more memory than is desirable.

#### Incorporating Metadata
When data files are transmitted to remote resources for model training, it may be useful to include metadata to add context for training algorithms. Metadata is stored in a DynamoDB database. In order to enable metadata, the user must make the following modifications.

1. In *CloudManager.swift*, in the method `uploadMetadata()`, add custom attributes for your DynamoDB table as explained in the comments provided. (Lines 261-271)
2. In *CloudManager.swift*, in the class `DatabaseClass`, specify your custom attributes, table name, and update the key - property table as specified in the comments. (Lines 347-372)

Note that `_userID` and `_eventDate` are required hash and range key attributes, respectively, and should not be modified or replaced by the user. However, any additional attribute fields may be added. Metadata may be added to the `LibraData` object with the function `addMetadata()`, which accepts metadata as a dictionary. A representative example is shown below.

```swift
// Construct a metadata dictionary
let myMetadata = ["_userID" : "User01", "_eventDate" : "20180929073331", "_customAttr" : "hello world"]
myData.addMetadata(withAttributes: myMetadata)  // Add metadata to object
```

Subsequently, metadata may be uploaded as well with the command `myData.uploadMetadataToRemote()`.

#### Data Management
To maintain regulatory compliance, it is often necessary to give the user of an application the ability to delete all data and metadata that has been collected remotely. `LibraData` provides the function `clearData()` for removing all data that is currently being processed (i.e. neither uploaded nor locally saved). For deleting remote files, we must use `CloudManager` directly. `CloudManager` provides the functions `removeAllUserFiles()` for clearing all data *files* from remote resources, and the function `removeAllUserMetadata()` for removing all *metadata*.
